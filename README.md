# Customer-Churn-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry using Power BI, SQL, and Python with Machine Learning. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior, analyze key churn factors, and develop a predictive model to forecast customers likely to churn.

# Technologies Used
# Power BI: Interactive dashboards for churn insights and trend analysis.
# SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and querying for customer churn datasets.
# Python & Machine Learning: Predictive modeling to identify potential churners.
# Project Workflow
# Data Extraction & Preparation (SQL)

Extract customer data from relational databases.
Perform data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
Create SQL queries to segment customers based on churn behavior.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (Power BI)

Develop interactive dashboards to visualize churn trends.
Identify key metrics (e.g., tenure, service usage, billing issues).
Use DAX functions for deeper insights into customer retention.
# Churn Prediction (Python & Machine Learning)

Use machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict churners.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Deploy the model for real-time predictions and insights.

# Business Insights & Recommendations

Identify key churn drivers and suggest retention strategies.
Provide actionable insights for customer retention campaigns.
Automate reporting with scheduled Power BI updates.

# Key Outcomes
A dynamic Power BI dashboard providing real-time churn analytics.
A SQL-based data pipeline for efficient data extraction and querying.
A machine learning model that predicts churn with high accuracy.
Actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

# This project helps telecom companies reduce churn, enhance customer experience, and optimize retention strategies using data-driven decision-making. ðŸš€
